RAP PART I
Spirit of Marilyn calling me
Audibly, bawling she
Said that she would never leave
Continue to torture me
Telling me to come with her
Underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her
Pills and some rum with her
Took me on the balcony
Telling me to jump with her
Yeah I'm in the ghost,
but I ain't doing stunts with her
I ain't trying to be that
Haters wanna see that
But I got 'em AGGY
'Cause I win the gold like Gabby
She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy
Lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe
But she knows she can fly away
(ooh's) She got both feet on the ground
and she's burning it down
(ooh's) She got her head in the clouds
and she's not backing down
CHORUS
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Looks like a girl
but she's a flame
So bright she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls
Say (ooh's)
we got our feet on the ground
and we're burning it down
(ooh's) got our head in the clouds and
we're not coming down
CHORUS
Everybody stares as she goes bye
'Cause they can see the flame
that's in her eyes
Watch her as she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she's gonna let it burn baby...burn baby
RAP PART II
Dear God, if you're here, God
Make the fire disappear when they stare, God
Take away my fear when they interfere, God
Do you fear God
'Cause I fear God
And in my backyard that's a dear God
And that's a horse ranch
And to my core fans keep reppin' me
Do it to the death of me
X in the box
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' me
CHORUS
(Oh's)
She's just a girl and she's on fire
